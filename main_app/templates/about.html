    <h2>What is WellNest?</h2>
    <p>
      WellNest is your personal sanctuary â€” a digital space where reflection, mindful habits,
      and emotional check-ins aren't an afterthought, but the heart of your every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe true wellness isn't just about grand gestures; it's woven into the tiny, sacred
      moments you choose yourself. WellNest gives you the tools to track, nurture, and celebrate your growth â€”
      gently, intentionally, and at your own pace.
    </p>
    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <p>
      In a world that rewards hustle over healing, WellNest was created to be a counterweight â€” a place where
      slowing down is strength. It's a space to be seen, supported, and to witness your own evolution.

    <h2>A Note from the Heart Behind WellNest</h2>
    <p>
      WellNest wasnâ€™t born from a single moment. It was built out of a thousand tiny ones â€” the quiet ache of losing parts of myself I thought I had to be, the joy of becoming parts I didnâ€™t know I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew during the wild seasons of my life: moving through the shifting roles of daughter, sister, aunt, wife, girlfriend, mother â€” and sometimes, standing entirely alone. It grew in the tired places, the terrified places, the places brimming with gratitude so fierce it felt like it might tear me open.
    </p>
    <p>
      WellNest was born from that gathering. A place where wellness isnâ€™t about perfection or achievement, but about presence. A place to honor the lost nights, the almosts, the beginnings you canâ€™t explain yet â€” and the slow, sacred art of becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word here, every gentle nudge, every small, stubborn hope â€” they are love letters to the version of you that is tired but trying. Afraid but still reaching. Proud, broken, healing, grateful, real.
    </p>
