    <p>
      We believe true wellness isn't just about grand gestures; it's woven into the tiny, sacred moments you choose yourself.

    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <p>
      In a world that rewards hustle over healing, WellNest was created to be a counterweight — a place where slowing down is strength,
      where your emotions, your routines, and your inner world matter deeply. 
      It's a space to be seen, supported, and to witness your own evolution.

    <h2>A Note from the Heart Behind WellNest</h2>
    <p>
      WellNest wasn’t born from a single moment. It was built out of a thousand tiny ones — the quiet ache of losing parts of myself I thought I had to be, the joy of becoming parts I didn’t know I could. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew during the wild seasons of my life: moving through the shifting roles of daughter, sister, aunt, wife, girlfriend, mother — and sometimes, standing entirely alone. It grew in the tired places, the terrified places, the places brimming with gratitude so fierce it felt like it might tear me open.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent years sprinting toward someone else's idea of "enough" — balancing ambition and caretaking, giving and giving until I barely recognized the woman in the mirror. Life, in its stubborn mercy, finally invited me to stop. To listen. To gather up all the messy, brilliant pieces I had dropped along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      WellNest was born from that gathering. A place where wellness isn’t about perfection or achievement, but about presence. A place to honor the lost nights, the almosts, the beginnings you can’t explain yet — and the slow, sacred art of becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word here, every gentle nudge, every small, stubborn hope — they are love letters to the version of you that is tired but trying. Afraid but still reaching. Proud, broken, healing, grateful, real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for letting WellNest be a part of your story. I'm proud of the woman who brought me here — and I'm proud of the woman I am still becoming.
