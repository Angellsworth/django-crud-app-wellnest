## 📘 About the App

**WellNest** is a personal wellness and habit journal designed to help users reconnect with themselves — one habit, one mood, one reflection at a time.

It’s a quiet, empowering space to track what matters most: how you’re feeling, what you’re building, and who you’re becoming. I built WellNest as a way to merge mental wellness and software — a place to hold small, gentle routines that support big growth. This app is deeply inspired by my own journey through healing, habit stacking, and tech bootcamping all at once.
